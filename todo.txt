Norme:
	snake_case for functions, variables, structs.
	PascalCase for classes names;

• Request: Start line, header, body
	First line: 
		- Method. (The method is a one-word command that tells the server
			what it should do with the resource. For example, the server could
			be asked to send the resource to the client.)
		- Path. (The path component of the URL for the request.
			The path identifies the resource on the server.)
		- HTTP version. (The HTTP version number, showing the HTTP specification to
			which the client has tried to make the message comply.)
		
		EXAMPLE:
			GET / HTTP/1.1
			Host: 

	Request might contain additional items:
		- Query string. (This provides a string of information that the resource
			can use for some purpose. It follows the path, and is preceded by a question mark.)
		- scheme (e.g. http), host (e.g. www.example.com)

• Methods:
	Methods are case-sensitive.
	- GET (The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
		Requests using GET should only retrieve data.)
		Body is empty.

	- POST (The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource,
		often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.)

		If one or more resources has been created on the origin server
		as a result of successfully processing a POST request, the origin
		server SHOULD send a 201 (Created) response containing a Location header field that provides an identifier for the primary resource created (Section 10.2.2) and a representation that describes the status of the request while referring to the new resource(s).

	- DELETE (The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.)

	Processing:
		https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html
		Make sure method is allowed in route.

• Response
	- HTTP version.
	- Status code (e.g. '200 OK')
	- Body

	More info on status codes: https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.codes

• Headers fields (headers)
	Headers fields sare case-insensitive.
	MIME types:
		type/subtype, example text/html

• CGI
	CGI uses environment variables, passed with execve.
	- Create an array of strings with env variables
	- use full path (pwd + path) as PATH_INFO

	parse query string:
	query string starts from '?' character
	format is <arg>=<value>
	args are separated with &

	example ?arg1=value1&arg2=value2
	arg1 = value1;
	arg2 = value2

set the first server for specific host:port as the default one (that will answer requests)

make sure method allowed in response
