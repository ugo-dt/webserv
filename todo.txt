[Server]
	• Request
		1. Method. (The method is a one-word command that tells the server
			what it should do with the resource. For example, the server could
			be asked to send the resource to the client.)
		2. Path. (The path component of the URL for the request.
			The path identifies the resource on the server.)
		3. HTTP version. (The HTTP version number, showing the HTTP specification to
			which the client has tried to make the message comply.)

		Request might contain additional items:
			- Query string. (This provides a string of information that the resource
				can use for some purpose. It follows the path, and is preceded by a question mark.)
			- scheme (e.g. http), host (e.g. www.example.com)

		Methods:
			- GET (The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
				Requests using GET should only retrieve data.)
			- POST (The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource,
				often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.)
			- DELETE (The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.)
